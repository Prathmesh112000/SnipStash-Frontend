🚀 SnipStash — Your Smart Snippet Organizer
Developers constantly copy snippets from StackOverflow, blog posts, or personal projects — but rarely organize them. They end up scattered across sticky notes, Notion docs, or random VS Code files… or worse, forgotten entirely.

SnipStash is a smart snippet organizer that lets developers quickly save, auto-tag, search, and manage reusable code snippets across multiple programming languages.

🎯 Objective
Build a fullstack web application where authenticated users can:

💾 Save reusable code snippets in various languages

🧠 Auto-categorize snippets based on patterns (no AI — just rule-based logic)

🏷️ Tag and group snippets manually

🔍 Search and filter snippets by tag, language, or keywords

📋 Quickly copy to clipboard for re-use

👤 User Roles
User (authenticated)
Each user has a private snippet vault — no public sharing needed for the MVP.

🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Secure email/password login/signup

All snippets and tags are user-scoped (only accessible to the owner)

Protected routes and access control for snippet operations

🔧 Core Features
1. Save a Snippet
Form fields:

Snippet title

Snippet code (multiline textarea with syntax highlighting)

Language dropdown (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Bash, etc.)

Optional: Tags and description

On submit: 🔍 "Smart Categorize" auto-generates relevant tags

2. Auto-Tagging Logic (Rule-based)
SnipStash analyzes submitted code snippets using pattern-matching:


Pattern	Tag
for, while	loop
fetch, axios, XMLHttpRequest	api
try, catch	error handling
.map, .filter()	array ops
console.log	debugging
Tags are editable by users later.
